Title: Demystifying Service Mesh: Separating Hype from Practicality

Summary:
Even if you’re new to Kubernetes, you’re probably feeling a little FOMO when it comes to Service Mesh technology. It’s everywhere and it seems like it solves all of the problems. But do you actually need it? What are the core functions of service mesh and how do I choose a technology? And how can I be sure to use the technology in an efficient way so that I don’t introduce unneeded complexity and reliability issues. In this session, we will dig into Service Mesh in detail and break down the common use cases and discuss best practices to use it to your advantage. We will review common pitfalls and talk about how Service Mesh fits into the journey through Cloud Native technologies. Of course, there will be demos!
